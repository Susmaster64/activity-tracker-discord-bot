## Usage

For usage, you can either [use my hosted instance](#hosted-instance) or self-host. Instructions for both are provided.
Non-specific instructions refer to both the provided and self hosted instances.

### Setup

VERY IMPORTANT: FIRST SETUP.

For first setup of the bot on a server, perform the following actions.
1. Create a channel for the bot, make sure the bot has nessicary permissions for this channel, and that NORMAL USERS DO NOT HAVE PERMISSIONS TO SEND MESSAGES IN THIS CHANNEL.
2. Run the command `/setreportchannel` in that channel.
3. COMPLETE THIS LATER, TODO.

### Hosted Instance
Because `hobby.db` is not limited per server. Therefore, to avoid random people adding random entries to the database, you should message me on discord or something to get bot usage link.

### Self Hosting
Put the python file on a server and like make an enviroment and install `aiosqlite`, `py-cord`, and `table2ascii`.
Also python have to be like some newer python 3 version or something idk.
Then make a database file called `hobby.db` in the directory where the python file is located.
Then put the discord bot's token in token.txt.
Then refer to the [setup instructions](#setup).
